This Serverless Full Stack Application is a modern and scalable web application where we will create a Serverless Full Stack Application using React.js and Material UI for the frontend, Node.js on AWS Lambda for the backend, and DynamoDB for data storage. The application's main feature is to display data from a DynamoDB table in a user-friendly web interface and provide a "Remove" button to delete selected records. Users can interact with the data and remove items as needed, creating a simple but practical web application.
